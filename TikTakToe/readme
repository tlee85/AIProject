This program allows you to play Tic Tac Toe against an AI opponent. The AI is smart and makes strategic moves using the minimax algorithm, providing a challenging gameplay experience. The game features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) where you can click on the grid cells to make your move. The AI will then make its move automatically, and the game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. You can reset the game at any time to start a new match.
Have Python 3.x installed along with the NumPy library. Once installed, you can run the program by executing python ui.py in the terminal. The Tic Tac Toe GUI will open, allowing you to start playing against the AI immediately.
